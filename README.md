# Welcome to My GitHub Repository! üöÄ

Welcome to my digital sandbox, where I tinker with code, wrestle with algorithms, and occasionally emerge victorious (or at least with a decent Stack Overflow search history).

## Who am I? ü§î

- **Coding enthusiast** since the age of 13 - turns out video games weren't enough of a challenge!
- **Back-End Developer** (geared up with a **Meta certification**)
- **Current student** at **Bangor University**, balancing the world of bits with the knowledge of finance through a Bachelor's in **Accounting & Finance**.

## What will you find here? üîç

- **Open source projects:** My explorations with building Django web applications - always looking to learn new ways to bring ideas to life!
- **Research experiments:** You'll also find Jupyter notebooks documenting my dives into financial data and what I've been able to learn along the way.
- **Random coding adventures:** Because sometimes you just gotta write code for the fun of it, even if it ends up making you laugh more than anything else.

## Why should you care? üåü

- Maybe you'll find some code that solves a problem you've been wrestling with.
- Maybe you'll get a good laugh at my expense (hey, it happens to the best of us).
- Maybe you'll just be impressed by my amazing collection of cat gifs (it's truly a sight to behold).

## Disclaimer: üö®

- This code may contain bugs. It may also contain traces of pizza and questionable life choices. Use at your own risk.
- I am not responsible for any existential crises caused by my research projects.
- The cat gifs are, however, guaranteed to be 100% adorable.

P.S. Keep an eye out for typos - my autocorrect has a strange sense of humor.
